# Setting up the environment

In order to start we will first have to install MongoDB. Good thing is that there are available instructions online for installation on their website \([http://mongodb.org](http://mongodb.org)\).

Programming tools such as Python and Jupyter notebook is also needed. Perhaps the easiest way to install all of these is by downloading Anaconda \([https://www.anaconda.com/downloads](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads)\).

For our python, you would need the following packages installed,

pymongo

### Installing Python Packages

If you have pip installed, which is by default included in anaconda, you cab install it by running 

`pip install pymongo `

or 

`python -m pip install pymongo`
